  caption: "El Templo de la Independencia - at least I think that's what it's called. In any case it's where the liberators Boliva (as in Bolivia's named after him) and Sucre fought the Spanish and liberated Quito in the late 18th century or early 19th century - I apologize for being vague but the tour was in Spanish and I couldn't catch it all. The mural is by a famous Ecuadorian artist and represents all stages - from left to right - of Ecuador's history. I have a better picture of the mural but it takes forever to upload pictures because the connection is really slow."

  caption: "La iglesia catolica de San Francisco. The church was mostly under construction but was still pretty cool. We also took a tour of the museum just out of the picture to the right."

  caption: "La basilica. It has a longer name but I can't remember it right now. The coolest thing about this church was instead of gargoyles it had all the animals (well, a lot of the animals) found in the Galapagos around the entire church to scare away demons."
