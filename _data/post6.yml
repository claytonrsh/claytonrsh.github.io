  caption: "Sorry to all of my steadfast picture viewers, this post will have no pictures. Don't fret, I'll get to it next week after I get back from Tiputini Research Center in the jungle. You read correctly, tomorrow at 5am I get up and go to the airport to take a plane, then a bus, then a boat, then a bus... and then a boat. And then walk to the beautiful (after those 8 hours of travel it better be) ecological research center."

  caption: "However, that is not the real reason for this post. We were all told from the day we arrived to be careful of thieves, and you know what? They were right. I have a new experience to put down in the books - I was robbed at gunpoint! How crazy is that? Anyway, before any of you worry - 'cause for some reason the first thing everyone asks when I tell them is, 'are you OK?' and it gets a little annoying - everything is fine. I guess if you count my cell phone they got away with 40-50 dollars of my stuff, which for them will equal probably more like 20-30 because what would they ever gain from an Andean Anthropology book? Yes they also took my wallet, but I canceled my cards within 20 minutes (don't worry Sharon, yours is safe in the drawer next to my bed). The most inconvenient bit is that they stole my Censo - my Ecuadorian ID. So I went to the Office of Migration and asked how to get a new one, as mine was stolen. The woman at the desk slured something really quickly about the desk in the back where I got it the first time. So I asked a quick question to make sure I was right and she said, 'Si, pero ahora no hay sistema.'' So I asked, 'Cuando?' and she shrugged y me dijo, 'Mas tarde.' Gotta love Ecuadorian government."
