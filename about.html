<p>At some point I may come back here and write something more about myself, but for now...</p>

<p>I work at <a href="http://cusp.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">CUSP</a> with the <a href="https://datahub.cusp.nyu.edu" target="_blank">Data Facilty team</a>, primarily getting the <a href="http://dataanalytics.umd.edu" target="_blank">Applied Data Analytics program</a> - a collaboration with UMD and UChicago - up and running.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Otherwise...</h3>
<p>I like all the normal things you'd expect a late 20 year old from rural, coastal Northern California who is a relatively recent (~2 years is recent right?) transplant to NYC to like. <i>Hint: my posts feature most of it...</i></p>
