<h2 class="section-heading">Building this site</h2>

First off, I'm writing this as I am in the process of building this site - which means this post is subject to change and/or complete removal. Sort of like this site overall, actually.

I have heard good things about Jekyll and have meant to build myself a personal website for years now, so I will be using Jekyll to build this on a mix of the Mac NYU-CUSP bought for me to use at work as well as my personal Linux (which runs Ubuntu 14.04 - yes I'm lazy and have not updated it to a newer Ubuntu version; yes I know I should and I'll get to it.... eventually.)

<h3 class="section-heading">The Setup</h3>

I started on my Ubuntu so had to go through the Jekyll etc setup on the Mac, which btw thanks to [this post](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/install-jekyll-on-os-x/) for providing the last missing step which I _think_ was simply updating Ruby but I'll just leave this sentence here because I ain't no developer.

The way I start a project is often in the middle, this site was no exception. For example, I started writing this in Middletown, NY, while visiting J&J (maybe I'll add their names with permission, or maybe I'll just leave that as a <i>cute</i> abbreviation) over Memorial Day weekend - just about a month ago, thus, the subtitle of this site. Go figure.

After watching a co-worker build a (yet-to-be-if-ever-released website) I learned a lot about Jekyll. So, I then found this theme which I like well enough (<a href="https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll" target="_blank">thanks to Start Bootstrap</a>), and that about wraps up this post.

<h3 class="section-heading"> Oh, also...</h3>
<p>If you were curious, dinner one of those nights in Middletown looked like this.</p>
