I very much enjoy being an uncle, so that seemed like a good place for my first _real_ post. Also, at some point I came across this [timeline theme](https://github.com/kirbyt/timeline-jekyll-theme){:target="_blank"} and it seems like tracking some cute pictures of my nephew and then niece is a good way to test it out. So, here goes.
